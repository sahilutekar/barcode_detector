# Barcode Detection using OpenCV and PyZBar

Barcode detection is a crucial task in various applications, including inventory management and ticketing systems. This repository provides a code snippet that demonstrates how to detect and decode barcodes from images using OpenCV and the PyZBar library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- Python installed on your system
- OpenCV and PyZBar libraries installed (use `pip install opencv-python pyzbar` to install them)
- An image containing barcodes that you want to detect

## Usage


Code Explanation

The barcode_detection.py file contains the code for barcode detection using OpenCV and PyZBar. Here's a brief overview of the code:

    Import the necessary libraries: cv2 for image processing and pyzbar.pyzbar for barcode decoding.

    Define the BarcodeReader function that takes an image file path as input and performs barcode detection.

    Load the image using OpenCV's imread function.

    Use the decode function from PyZBar to detect barcodes in the image.

    Set minimum width and height thresholds for barcode regions to filter out small regions that are unlikely to be valid barcodes.

    Iterate over each detected barcode, draw a bounding rectangle around it using OpenCV's rectangle function, and print the barcode's data and type.

    Save the modified image with the highlighted barcode rectangles as a separate output image file.

    Run the BarcodeReader function on the provided image file.

Feel free to modify the code based on your specific requirements, such as adjusting the minimum size thresholds or incorporating additional functionality for barcode decoding.
